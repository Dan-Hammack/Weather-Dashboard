# Weather-Dashboard
 Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Built this HW using multiple youtube videos and my brothers help.  Due to having very little time available I'm submitting this HW as partially complete. 

Will update read me, styling, and fuctionallity of hw assignment when I find more time.
